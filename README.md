This code first uploads the data on Python from Kaggle, an online data repository, through its API.

It then cleans the data and deals with missing values.

And then proceed in applying several models to predict the return of the stock.

The following libraries are required:

matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
xgboost
kagglehub
